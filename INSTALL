Step 1: install Midori and its dependencies:
	This plugin is tested with Midori 0.2.4, 0.2.6-0.2.9;
	Gtk+ 2.20.1; WebKitGTK 1.2.3.

Step 2: install devel-packages:
	gtk+-devel, webkit-gtk-devel and sqlite3-devel are required.
	Also install asciidoc and xsltproc if you want to build documentation.

Step 3 (optional): replace Midori headers:
	Midorator needs headers from Midori tarball to compile. Headers
	from Midori-0.2.6 are already provided in directory './include'.
	They should be sufficient, but better replace them with headers
	from your version of Midori.

Step 4: build:
	Run as current user:
	 $ make
	If you want to build documentation, run:
	 $ make doc

Step 5: install:
	To install Midorator to default directory, run as root:
	 # make install
	If you hold Midori plugins in another directory, run instead:
	 # make MIDORI_LIBDIR=/path/to/plugins/ make install
	To install documentation, run:
	 # make install-doc

Step 6: enable:
	Run Midori, open panel 'Extensions' and enable Midorator.
